## Description
Using new found knowledge on Java and DOM elements, we were instructed to create a dynamic blog post where the user can creatively express thoughts and opinions. Apart from gathering data from local storage, we were to customize the page so that when acessing at any time the user can change the theme of the page to light/dark. User has the option to also delete posts that they no longer want to keep. The Blog Spot serves as a means to gather ones thoughts and put them on an evolving webpage.
